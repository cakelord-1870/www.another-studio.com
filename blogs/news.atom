<p>It’s jumper season! But plants can't just throw on a baggy jumper and woolly socks, so how are you keeping your plants happy in the cold?  Here are our top tips to keep indoor and outdoor plants happy and warm over winter. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><b>Indoor Plants</b></h3>
<p><b>Heat versus humidity </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turning the heating up during the colder months can reduce humidity levels which a lot of plants won’t appreciate! To add moisture back into your room try some, or all, of the following: Air dry your washing indoors, group plants together, mist regularly or place a tray or dish of pebbles half-filled with water underneath your plant. Failing that, a sure win is to use a humidifier. </span></p>
<br>
<p><b>New home in the sun </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In December we get less than 8 hours of sunlight a day *laughter from Australia* so it’s important to maximise the amount of sunlight your plants receive. Move them to a west or south-facing window, but not so close they get a draft. </span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Winter cleaning</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give your plants a clean, removing any dust that has accumulated on their leaves - this will allow them to soak up more sunshine. </span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Relocate and rehydrate</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Move your plants away from any radiators as they won’t like the dry hot air.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Plants need a lot less water in the winter as their growth slows down (some even going completely dormant) but they will still need a little drink. Check the soil and look at plant leaves. Droopy stems or curling leaves often indicates they are thirsty, whilst yellow leaves are a sign they’re had too much to drink.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re like us and have a few too many plants to keep track of, use our <a href="https://www.another-studio.com/products/brass-plant-posts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brass Plant flags</a> as reminders for your winter care tips. </span></p>
<div><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0027/6522/6043/files/Winter-Plant-Care-Blog-flags_480x480.jpg?v=1603903875" alt="Another Studio Plant Flags" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></div>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><b>Outdoor Plants</b></h3>
<p><b>Ditch the dish</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remove your plant pots from their saucers. This will provide better drainage and means they’re not sitting in water, which could freeze and damage the roots and even the pot.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Elevate </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use pot feet, bricks or wood blocks to raise your pots a few centimetres off the ground, allowing water to easily drain before it becomes too cold or even freezing.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Head for the wall</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Move vulnerable plants against a wall of your house, this will provide some shelter.</span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Mulch Mulch Mulch</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For an extra layer of insulation, add a coarse mulch to the top of you pots and flowerbeds. Mulch is also excellent at keeping weeds away! </span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Wrap them up </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re in an area prone to abrupt temperature changes, frost and snow, use bubble wrap, horticultural fleece or hessian fabric to tightly wrap up your pots. </span></p>
<br>
<p><b>Go Green</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re lucky enough to have a greenhouse, obvious advice but use it! If you don’t have a greenhouse, there are plenty of affordable PVC options you can easily order online. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’ll also be perfect in the spring for planting seeds and keeping them safe from birds &amp; squirrels.</span></p>

<p>As our Terrarium obsession continues to grow, we decided to make our own. Terrariums are very easy to make and are a lovely addition to any room, giving a calming dose of greenery to even the smallest of spaces. Enjoy the benefits of the garden without the burden. </p>
<p><br>To make our Terrarium we used <a href="https://www.romeoandsucculent.co.uk/product/terrarium-tool-kit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romeo &amp; Succulents <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Terrarium kit.</span></a><br><strong>The kit included:</strong><br>1 x Long Spoon<br>1 x Bamboo Needle<br>1 x Brush<br>1 x Small Bag of Activated Charcoal<br>1 x Small Piece of Live Cushion Moss<br>1 x Piece of Mesh<br>2 x Bags of Sand in Black and White<br>1 x Small Bag of Gold and Copper Decorative Stones<br><br><strong>You will also need:<br></strong>A glass vessel of your choice<br>A selection of small house plants, we chose Mosaic plants and Caladium.<br>Houseplant soil<br>Gravel<br>Scissors<br>Spray water bottle<br><br></p>
<div><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0027/6522/6043/files/terrarium-kit_grande.jpg?v=1598434002" alt="Romeo &amp; Succulents Terrarium kit" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></div>
<br>
<ol>
<li>Once you have chosen your container, make sure it’s cleaned and dry. Do not use any harsh cleaning products as this could affect the plants. It’s best to use a container with a wide enough opening to accommodate your hand.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Put a layer of gravel into the bottom of your container and level out, be gentle when you are adding your gravel as you don't want to chip the glass. This step is important for drainage in your terrarium.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Next, cut your mesh to fit the inside of your terrarium and lay on top of your gravel. This will act as a protective layer to stop soil falling into the gravel, keeping your terrarium looking neat. Now add a thin layer of soil, pat down evenly, and neaten around the edges of the container using a brush.<br><br><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0027/6522/6043/files/Jar-mesh-gravel_grande.jpg?v=1598434163" alt="Adding the gravel to our vessel " style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><br><br>
</li>
<li>Carefully add a layer of sand around the edge of the terrarium where the soil meets the glass, the sand doesn’t need to go in the middle of the container. Use your paintbrush to neaten the edges.<br><br><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0027/6522/6043/files/jar-sand-soil_grande.jpg?v=1598434209" alt="Adding soil, sand, and then more soil" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><br><br>
</li>
<li>Add your final layer of soil across the whole terrarium, sprinkling in your charcoal as you go along, which will help prevent bacterial growth and keep the plants healthy. Ensure that the soil is deep enough to plant the roots of your plants. Tidy any soil that’s crept up the glass with your paintbrush.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Decide where you want to place your plants, starting with the biggest. Using your long spoon, poke some holes in the soil, place in your plant, and firm the soil around it. Make sure your plants don’t touch the sides of the container. This step can be a bit fiddly and we found using the needle to wiggle the plants in place very helpful.<br><br><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0027/6522/6043/files/plants_ac8ff23e-56ce-4cef-8bb2-d43b47c967be_grande.jpg?v=1598434248" alt="Plant madness, choosing out plants " style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><br><br>
</li>
<li>Now it’s time to add your finishing touches. We added the moss from our Romeo Succulents kit, some gravel, a piece of driftwood, and completed our terrarium with our <a href="https://www.another-studio.com/collections/gift-ideas-novelty/products/castle-minionaire" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mini Model Castle</span>,</a> but our <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.another-studio.com/collections/gift-ideas-novelty/products/house-minionaire" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mini Model House</a></span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.another-studio.com/collections/gift-ideas-novelty/products/ferris-wheel-minionaire" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ferris Wheel</a></span> look equally as good. <br><br>
</li>
<li>Finally give your whole terrarium a spray with water, ideally with rain or filtered. If your terrarium has a lid - close it! Place somewhere with plenty of light but out of direct sunlight, and keep away from drafty areas or areas of extreme heat such as radiators. </li>
</ol>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0027/6522/6043/files/castle-terrarium-portrait_grande.jpg?v=1598434474" alt="Our final terrarium with Mini Model Castle" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><br><br><strong>Care tips:</strong><br><br>Lightly water your terrarium every 1-2 weeks, or if it’s looking dry. Use a spray bottle for even watering and so you don’t disrupt your scene. This is also a good time to remove any dead leaves. <br><br>If your terrarium is building up condensation (which never seems to go away) open the lid for a few hours to allow the extra water to evaporate. <br><br>Don’t have a glass container? No problem! You can repurpose an old bowl or finished candle pot.</p>

<h1><span>Five tips to keep your house plants thriving in a heatwave!</span></h1>
<p><br>There is no running away from the heat this week.</p>
<p>Finally here’s the moment we’ve been asking for. Putting that summer outfit on and getting our toes out… and of course, complain unceasingly about it being too hot.</p>
<p>But how are your plants doing in the heat? We’ve got 5 easy tips to keep them happy and thriving.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Spray, spray, spray</strong> <br>Make sure to mist the leaves to maintain good humidity.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Do the finger test <br></strong>Check your plant moisture levels more often than you would normally do. When it’s particularly hot, some plants watering needs will have changed.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Mind the gap</strong> <br>A space between the soil and the side of the pot is a good indicator your plant is thirsty.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>No soggy bottoms</strong> <br>Your plants will enjoy a nice bath, but remember to allow them to drain thoroughly after.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Nobody likes sunburn</strong> <br>It might be a good idea to your plants out of intense direct sunlight</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"> </p>
<p>Lastly, do reward them for their (your) hard work! Whether they are just about <strong><em><a href="https://www.another-studio.com/collections/plant-gifts/products/plant-award-surviving" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">surviving</a></em></strong>, <strong><em><a href="https://www.another-studio.com/collections/plant-gifts/products/plant-award-thriving" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thriving</a></em></strong> nicely, or being an absolute <em><strong><a href="https://www.another-studio.com/collections/plant-gifts/products/plant-award-dream-plant" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dream plant</a></strong></em>, shower them with praise!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.another-studio.com/collections/plant-gifts/products/plant-award-dream-plant" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="plant ornaments awards" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0027/6522/6043/products/P-AW-Dream-Plant-green-1500_grande.jpg?v=1571725610" style="float: none;"></a></p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>Over the past couple of months, life has been turned upside down for most of us.

      <![CDATA[<p>Happy Earth Day! This year marks the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Earth Day, focused on the theme of climate change. Climate change represents the biggest challenge to the future of humanity and the life-support systems that make our world habitable.</p>
<p>With such a big challenge on our hands its easy to think that the small changes we make as individuals, can’t possibly matter. Well, they do. At Another Studio, we’re trying our best to make small and effective changes to help with sustainability. We care about the environment and promise all new products will be using a starch-based cellophane by 2021 and our studio is 100% plastic free!</p>
<p>Another way we can help with sustainability is growing our own greens! We wanted to get tips from a pro on her experiences and the little changes you could apply in your life. We spoke with Violet Bennell, founder of <a href="https://superbherbs.co.uk/">Superb Herbs</a>, about her interests in horticulture and here’s what she had to tell us;</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Can you tell us what initially got you interested in horticulture and herbs!? </strong></p>
<p>I moved into a flat with a big garden that was basically a jungle of stinging nettles, in working out what to do with it I slowly became a little obsessed with plants. I couldn't stop thinking about them! So I decided to start from the beginning and studied for an RHS Principles of Horticulture Diploma whilst working in another profession entirely. Herbs always interested me because they all have stories to tell, whether it's finding out about them in history or how different cultures use them. They are also a joy for the senses! </p>
<p> <img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0027/6522/6043/files/5.DSC_0618.jpg?v=1585918870" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>How many herbs do you have growing at home at one time? </strong></p>
<p>It's probably almost 100! </p>
<p><strong>What's your top tip for maintaining herb plants at home? </strong></p>
<p>I probably couldn't give just one tip! Find out about your herb and try to recreate its natural environment as much as possible. Give your plants a real big drink less often as opposed to little drips, and water in at soil level, the leaves don't need the water! </p>
<p>Aerate your pots using a thin stick and poking it in to your potting mix, all the way to the bottom. </p>
<p> <img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0027/6522/6043/files/6.Superb_Herbs_Workshops_1.jpg?v=1585918877" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Favourite/ most versatile herb you've come across? </strong></p>
<p>I think the classic Rosemary is great for a few reasons. Rosemary is of course brilliant in cooking (fresh foccacia with rosemary mmmm!) It’s also great in a tea to revive and get the blood pumping. Great for your skin in a facial steam, then let the water cool and use it as a re-balancing scalp rinse. </p>
<p><strong>In a time where everyone is talking about the importance of being more sustainable and green, what are some practical tips you can give to help a newbie plant parent?</strong></p>
<p>When buying new compost try to use peat free (peat is an unsustainable natural resource that is crucial to many wild habitats). </p>
<p>Buy plants grown as locally to you as possible, your local nurseries and growers will also have great tips about what will grow well where you live. </p>
<p>Try to help wildlife and not to be too tidy in your garden, leave a pile of logs, leave a few weeds, the wildlife in your area will thank you for it and probably return the favour with natural pest control! Did you know ladybirds love to much on apids? Even better if you can grow or leave a few wildflowers growing for bees and other pollinators. </p>
<p>Feeding the birds in your garden is also a great way to encourage wildlife and they will nibble on some of your pests too. Don't forget to leave them out a shallow dish of water too. </p>
<p> <img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0027/6522/6043/files/3.ladybird_and_caraway.JPG?v=1585917921" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Final TOP TIP on being green?</strong></p>
<p>If you can start your own compost that's also a great way to sustainably recycle kitchen scraps and garden waste, or if not try and use your council green waste collection. It's an amazing way to turn your onion peelings into great compost for gardens to flourish and avoid it just going to landfill!</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>There's a lot going on at the moment, so it's easy to forget to take time for yourself. Spending just 30 minutes a day doing something calming and enjoyable can really help reduce stress levels. We're doing our best to take a little time each day (aside from work and managing daily life) for some mindful activities. Take a look at some of our favourite things to do!</p>
<p><strong>Get creative with hand-written letters.</strong></p>
<p>If you’ve got a little extra time on your hands, why not write someone a letter? Not just any ordinary letter... get creative and practice your <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.another-studio.com/collections/stationery" target="_blank" title="stencils" rel="noopener noreferrer">stencilling</a>.</span> Or, work on your to do list in style!</p>
<p><strong><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hZhptOBuB2w" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></strong></p>
<p><strong>Work up a sweat… or not!</strong><br>Exercise is so important to keep your body and mind healthy. Especially at a time like this. Forget the gym, work out in your garden or in your living room (no need for a sports bra!). Get in some HIIT or something a little gentler; whatever works for you and how you feel.<br><br><strong>Share some sweet treats.</strong><br>Mary Berry has got nothing on you! There are so many easy access online recipes out there for you to try. Pick something you can prep in 30 mins and pop in the oven.<br><br><strong>Finish that book.</strong><br>We all have good intentions of getting more reading done, but often busy schedules get in the way! I like to take 30 minutes before getting up to read my bedside book; before the day really starts and life takes over, give it a try!</p>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0027/6522/6043/files/books.jpg?v=1585603758" alt=""></p>
<p><br><strong>Get arts and craftsy.</strong><br>There’s so much that can be done in this category. Colour by numbers, paint, work on a scrapbook for the printed pics in the back of the wardrobe (or is this one just me?), up-cycle an old accessory or piece of furniture that needs some TLC. The ideas are endless!<br><br><strong>Fresh air = freedom.</strong><br>Take a walk, jog, run or sprint around your local green space. Just taking 20-30 minutes to breathe in some refreshing cool air will help clear your mind for the day ahead.<br><br><strong>Tend to those weeds.</strong><br>Get in the garden! Work on that veg patch, flower box or tend to those house plants! Getting back to nature and the feeling of keeping your plant babies alive is a great project. <a href="https://www.another-studio.com/collections/plant-gifts/products/houseplant-care-cards" title="care cards"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Check out our House Plant Care Cards</span></a> if you want our top tips.</p>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0027/6522/6043/files/plants.jpg?v=1585603769" alt=""></p>
<p><br><strong>Who doesn’t love a Spring clean?</strong><br>A having a clear out is perfect for refocusing your space and your mind. It doesn’t have to be a chore either, get your favourite Spotify playlist on and you’ll be singing and dancing so much, you won’t even realise you’re doing housework! <br><br><strong>Learn that ‘how to’ thing you never have time for.</strong><br>How to knit, bake a cake, create that special recipe, learn Spanish, practice those yoga poses or upcycle that old chair. There’s always something we wish we had more time for, well create that 30 minutes for yourself everyday and little by little you’ll gain those skills.<br><br><strong>Listen to a new podcast.</strong><br>Podcasts are perfect for a multi-tasker! Take a walk and listen to a podcast. There are thousands of them in every imaginable genre. <a href="https://www.another-studio.com/blogs/news/our-favourite-podcasts" target="_blank" title="Podcast blog" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Check out this list of our favourites if you need some inspiration!</span> </a></p>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0027/6522/6043/files/podcast_image.jpg?v=1585603751" alt=""></p>
<p><br><strong>Yoga or meditation? </strong><br>Sun Salutations or Yoga Nidra? An ancient art of relaxation and mindfulness. Whether perfecting on your downward dog or resting in child’s pose, working on your yoga practice will help refresh your mind, on and off the mat.<br><br><strong>Dance like nobody’s watching… because they’re not.</strong><br>Put on that album you haven’t listened to for ages, crank it up a little too loud and DANCE! Dance around your room, kitchen or living room. A great form of exercise and certainly a way to put a smile on your face.</p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<p>Here at Another Studio, we’ve been big Podcast listeners for many years now. It all started when I first listened to <em>Serial</em>, the breakthrough podcast from This American Life, hosted by Sarah Koenig. If you are new to the podcast world and haven’t listened to this (where have you been?!) I suggest you start here as you’ll be hooked! There are now three seasons of investigative journalism into three true stories. It’s brilliantly addictive.</p>
<p>There are thousands of podcasts out there but it’s still sometimes difficult to find something good to listen to. My top tip for finding the next best listen is to follow the podcast producer. My Favourites are The Wondery, Gimlet Media and NPR.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s a round-up of some of our favourite podcasts - we’d love to know yours too!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>News, Politics, Current Affairs</strong></p>
<p>The Journal - Every weekday, reporting on one current affairs topic each day.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p><strong>In celebration of this 10-year anniversary our founder, Aimée Furnival, reflects on the inspirations behind Another Studio and her achievements over the last 10 years.</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Tell us what inspired the inception of AS?</strong></p>
<p>I always wanted to be a designer-maker. During my BA degree I specialised in ceramics but it’s not the easiest practice to start up as you need a studio and kiln at the very least. So, I starting designing product ideas in my spare time within the constraints of a dining room table and laptop. From a young age I always sent a lot of letters or bits of ‘treasure’ and postcards to my family and friends, so I wanted to concentrate on small gifts - easy to post but offering something more than a greeting card.</p>
<p><strong>What’s been the biggest inspiration in designing the different collections?</strong></p>
<p>A big inspiration for me has been London living. I’ve been fascinated with the city’s architecture, both the buildings and the lifestyle. For years I craved my own garden but my small flat offered only space for window boxes. Ever since I’ve been inspired by this theme of ‘city living’ and ‘indoor gardening’. Playing with scale is also really important and is seen throughout all the collections. </p>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0027/6522/6043/files/blog_london_bridge.jpg?v=1582036618" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Your biggest achievement of the last 10 years?</strong></p>
<p>Believe it or not one of my first press features was a whole page in Elle Decoration! It happened within 6 months of launching my first product and I don’t really think I realised how big a deal that was at the time because I was so busy! Getting my own studio space at Cockpit Arts also felt like a big moment. I was familiar with the creative space since I was at university - it’s like a super professional art collage for businesses. I felt really grounded and I’ve met so many like-minded creatives here that have become really good friends. </p>
<p><strong>Tell us about some of the difficulties you’ve faced.</strong></p>
<p>There have been some testing times and I can’t say every idea or decision has been the right one but I love doing this because you're constantly challenged and always learning. You juggle so much and wear so many hats that you become part of your business, it’s a lifestyle and much more than job.</p>
<p><strong>Favourite piece you’ve designed?</strong></p>
<p>Hands down Plantini - a miniature plant house kit. It was a collaboration with model maker Franki Finch and is a stunning piece. We’ve discontinued the model now but will always be proud of this one.</p>
<p><strong>Favourite piece from the current online products?</strong></p>
<p>Plant Animals - flying squirrel. He’s just ridiculous in such a good way.</p>
<p> <img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0027/6522/6043/files/Blog_Squirrel.jpg?v=1582036640" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Something that people might not know about Another Studio?  </strong></p>
<p>I always have at least 15 product ideas waiting to come to fruition. We’ve designed &amp; produced nearly 200 different products! Many are exclusive commissions and some have now been discontinued.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you see Another Studio going in the next 10 years?</strong></p>
<p>I love working in small team so have no plans to get much bigger, but I do intend for us to always bring our best and get better.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p> </p>
<p>We're delighted to announce we reached the final of the first global Etsy Design Awards! We entered our little <a href="https://www.another-studio.com/collections/plant-animals">Plant Animals</a> and are super happy to hear they were selected as a finalist in the Inventive Decor category.</p>
<p><span>Etsy is the leading marketplace designers, makers....actually </span>all types of creative people selling their work direct to the end customer. It's a great platform with a lovely seller community and the nicest customers. We have been selling on here since 2015 and have received <a href="https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/AnotherStudio?ref=seller-platform-mcnav#reviews">550+ five star reviews</a> and shipped over 4000 orders to date.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>I was asked to do a radio interview in the UK so here's the Q&amp;A.</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>Describe you products</strong><br>The designs entered for the Etsies are our <a href="https://www.another-studio.com/collections/plant-animals">Plant Animals</a> - miniature brass animals which attach to your houseplants. Think of them as little pets for your plants!<br><br><strong>What made you decide to start the company?</strong><br>Ten years ago I felt there was a gap in the market  for fun, well designed gifts that you could easily send in the post. I wanted to create something unique you could pick up for under £10, designs that were really different, looked great, made people smile but were contemporary and not tacky.<br><br><strong>What difficulties did you face?</strong><br>Lots, but that’s part of the challenge! There are constantly problems to solve and things to better. Balancing my work load can always struggle, particularly making time for the creative side whilst taking part in trade shows, managing production and planning marketing campaigns. The last few years have been much easier as I now have a great team around me.<br><br><strong>How have companies like Etsy helped you grow your business?</strong><br>So important to reaching to the end consumer who value original unique designs. We have a 5* review rating from our Etsy customers which has really helped gain a level of trust to new customers.<br><br><strong>What does it mean to you to be a finalist in the Etsy Design Awards?</strong><br>The fact this is a global award is huge! It’s a massive stamp of approval and great opportunity for me to celebrate how far the company has come. </p>
<meta charset="utf-8">

<p class="p2"><strong>And the Grand Prize Winner is..........</strong></p>

      <![CDATA[<p>Summer is the perfect time to propagate your plants and Spider plants are very easy to grow from a cutting. We choose to grow our cuttings in water and they take around 6 weeks from when you first put them in some water. </p>
<p>There are 4 easy steps to follow.</p>
<p>1. Take a cutting from the plantlet of the Mother plant. These are the little 'baby' plants that are on the long stems of the main plant as pictured below.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0027/6522/6043/files/spider-plantlet_1024x1024.jpg?v=1561634149" alt="how to propagate a spider plant"></p>
<p> 2. Cut close to the 'bump' of the plantlet </p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="propagating a spider plant" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0027/6522/6043/files/Spider_1_1024x1024.jpg?v=1560950778" style="float: none;"></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">3. Place your trimmed Spider baby in some water making sure that only the bottom bit is dipped in. We used some sticky tape to keep it at the right level in the glass! </p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p style="text-align: left;">Check the water level daily (the cutting must always be in water) and change the water each week to prevent it stagnating.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="how to propagate a spider plant" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0027/6522/6043/files/Spider-3_1024x1024.jpg?v=1560951343" style="float: none;"></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">4. It will be happy living in water for several weeks but once it's sprouted a few roots you can repot using and all purpose potting mixture. Place your new plant in indirect sunlight, water regularly and watch it grow! </p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="propagating a spider plant" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0027/6522/6043/files/spider-plant-roots_1024x1024.jpg?v=1561634069" style="float: none;"></p>

<p><span>The photographer’s admiration for nature, especially for birds, arose during his childhood thanks to unforgettable long walks with his grandfather. </span></p>

<p>His work captures birds in a single time frame. His images show the shapes they generate when flying, the incredible flight paths they take which are normally invisible to us.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p class="p1">This month marked nine years since I launched the first product for Another Studio. It’s interesting to look back through the archives and see how the company has grown.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We are still a micro team but unbelievably we've now designed and produced well over 100 individual items! Most design are for our own giftware collection but many have been exclusive commissions for a range of creative and cultural enterprises.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s been an amazing journey thus far with many highs and lows, twists and turns bringing us to today. Read on for a brief nine year history of the journey so far.</p>

<h1 class="p1">2010 - PostCarden &amp; lots of press</h1>
<p class="p1"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0027/6522/6043/files/2_0f957593-33e3-4641-8d66-8518330dbe37.jpg?v=1550504924" alt="Postcarden growing card"></p>
<p class="p1">In February 2010 I received the first production of PostCarden making it the first product I had ever designed and manufactured. I’d barely shown it to anyone before sending a press release out from my tiny flat. I was terrified and clearly a bit bonkers!</p>
<p class="p1">Thankfully, the press loved it and quite quickly it gained a lot of interest in blogs, news papers and magazines around the world. It even received a whole page feature in Elle Decoration! It was an unbelievable year which ended with luxury high fashion brand Hermés commissioning me to create a bespoke growing mailer. Never would I have predicted my business would start so well.</p>

<h1 class="p1">2011 - Growing kits galore</h1>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0027/6522/6043/files/3_899376f5-55fb-4c8a-bd29-2aa26403bdd0.jpg?v=1550506130" alt="Little growing kits"> </p>
<p class="p1">In the second year I started to design more growing kits and took on Lahla Smart as a design intern to help create Matchcarden (today, Lahla still works for me as a freelance product designer and we’ve grown to be great friends). My good friend Frank kindly let us set up a studio in his office off Oxford Circus so we were living the dream working from central London with press, orders and projects coming in thick and fast and taking commissions from clients such as Selfridges.</p>
<p class="p1">I started to work with model maker <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.finchandfouracre.co.uk/">Franki Finch</a></span> and together we created Plantini which is still one of my favourite designs. I worked with five different factories to make this product - a big challenge at the time to find the right people to work with. I loved going down to visit the main packaging factory in Wales - they were so kind and patient, helping share their wealth of experience and knowledge and were always up for experimenting. Finding reliable manufacturers has been key and I value them so much.</p>

<h1>2012 - New studio at Cockpit Arts</h1>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0027/6522/6043/files/4_2c02db06-a581-44a3-b0e6-b868eb0fb1cf.jpg?v=1550507043" alt="another studio"></p>
<p class="p1">In July 2012 I moved into a permanent space at Cockpit Arts in Holborn, central London.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Cockpit Arts is a social enterprise that is home to some 150+ talented designer-makers over two London locations. Being part of this creative community has been amazing and I’m lucky to have made many close friends since joining and I absolutely love being part of this place. They are a pretty fun and talented bunch ranging from ceramists to jewellers, illustrators to weavers.</p>
<p class="p1">Product wise I continued to work with Franki Finch and launched MONUmini, a range of architectural models. There were a number of projects on the side, one that stood out was a bespoke invitation mailer for Walt Disney which they used to promote a new film.</p>
<p class="p1"> </p>

<h1> 2013 - Not everything works</h1>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0027/6522/6043/files/5.jpg?v=1550508253" alt="Sir john soane architectural model"></p>
<p class="p1">This year was the first test on how not everything works out well. I’d had three incredible years and was maybe a bit overworked and exhausted. I designed two really uninspiring product ranges which were wrong in many ways making it quite a learning curve, as up to this date everything I produced had been a big success. The failure hurt a lot at the time but was so important to go through (not saying I’d like to do that again!) I wasn’t passionate about the new products so they were difficult to sell and I discontinued them pretty quickly!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Luckily I did take on an amazing commission for the Sir Johns Soane’s Museum and produced a series of products for them.</p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<h1 class="p1">2014 - City loving &amp; big projects</h1>
<p class="p1"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0027/6522/6043/files/6_d8b11472-ab30-4d7d-9226-d964d5dcff64.jpg?v=1550509583" alt="architectural inspired gifts"></p>
<p class="p1">I cycle everywhere and for this years commute I went over waterloo bridge everyday. The views from the bridge are amazing and I started to look back to architecture for some inspiration for a new product. In a couple of days I designed the first set of City Clips - architectural bookmarks 5000 times smaller than the really buildings which became quite a hit so more cities followed. I also started to experiment with larger scale sculptural pieces and the Convert Vase was launched - all made from a single sheet of metal.</p>
<p class="p1">During this year we took on several large commissions, in particular a big project for Google to produce an exclusive pop-up growing card. It was a huge order with very tight deadlines and resulted in many sleepless nights! At one point there were 18 people working in the studio to get it completed on time.</p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<h1 class="p1"><strong>2015 - Change of direction</strong></h1>
<p><strong><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0027/6522/6043/files/7.jpg?v=1550510650" alt="geometric designs"></strong></p>
<p class="p1">In 2015 I felt a need to change direction. I took on some distributors who would look after the wholesale customers and give me more free time to take on projects and experiment with new metals and processes. We worked on a number of exclusive product ranges for the Science Museum, Westminster Abbey, Royal Albert Hall and Hotel De Ville de Paris.</p>
<p class="p1">In between projects I experimented with an origami style design using thin sheets of wood. The result was a hand made range called Lignum Fold which consisted of a geometric lampshade, pencil pot, bowl and dish which we launched at design junction. </p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<h1 class="p1">2016 -  Little things and lighting</h1>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0027/6522/6043/files/8.jpg?v=1550511463" alt="Another Studio"> </p>
<p class="p1">A new website and identity refreshed the brand. I continued my slight obsession with miniature items and we designed the ultimate range of tiny objects of desire ‘mini-onaires'.</p>
<p class="p1">This was an odd year as I wanted to continue making hand made pieces, still sell the exciting range of gifts and keep working with clients. It’s fair to say the three did not marry and it was becoming very confusing about what direction the company was going in. I had an urge to experiment and push the boundaries of what I was designing and in September we launched Timber Tailor, a range of hand crafted wood light-shades inspired by dress making. We had a few commissions but quickly I realised we did not have the space, free hands,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>and if I’m really honest the desire to make all these very time consuming items by hand.</p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<h1 class="p1"> 2017 - Turning point</h1>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0027/6522/6043/files/9.jpg?v=1550512882" alt="plant animals"></p>
<p class="p1">In 2017 I decided we needed to refocus and do one thing really well. I had to choose between hand making wooden objects (this needed greater time and resources given to it) or focus on great gifts and playful products. The second option was hands down more sensible and more fun. Again I looked to indoor gardening and architecture for inspiration and felt decorations for houseplants should be a thing. And so Plant Animals were born, cute creatures to hang from your houseplants! I wasn’t certain anyone would ‘get’ them or like them as much but they quickly became a thing!</p>
<p class="p2">We also slogged over a mammoth architectural map of London’s River Thames which featured the history and heritage of 100 buildings situated from Tower bridge to Houses of Parliament. It was so interesting to research the rich history of the buildings along the river and made me love this city even more.</p>
<p class="p1">We took back our distribution and started doing trade shows again,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>designed and produced a range of products for Historic Scotland and made an army of NYC water towers for a new hotel in Williamsburg!</p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<h1 class="p1">2018 - Relocating &amp; all things planty</h1>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0027/6522/6043/files/10.jpg?v=1550513405" alt="plant themed gifts"></p>
<p class="p1">For a couple of years we’ve needed a bigger studio space so we took the big step of moving studio South of the river to Cockpit Arts, Deptford.</p>
<p class="p1">Our studio is now bright and full of light, perfect for housing our growing plant collection. It’s quieter than central London but still home to lots of fantastic designers so we have the same community buzz. We’ve been designing all things plant related such as the House Plant Care Cards, a Houseplant print, Hanging Bird and launched a flashy new website. We've also enjoyed exhibiting at various shows and dealing direct with all our lovely wholesale customers - by the end of this year we had over 200 stockists in 18 countries! </p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<h1 class="p1">2019 - Watch this space</h1>
<p class="p1"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0027/6522/6043/files/11.jpg?v=1550513628" alt=""></p>
<p class="p1">Going into our tenth year we have lots of exciting designs in the pipeline and plans for the year ahead. Lots of new fun gifts will be launched this year. We’ve already out grown our new studio so are now on the hunt for a shop space in London. Hopefully we'll find one in time to celebrate our 10 year anniversary!</p>
